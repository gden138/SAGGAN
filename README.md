Introduction

This repository is for our paper 'GAN-based Semi-supervised Scene Classification of Remote Sensing Image'. We propose a novel GAN-based semi-supervised scene classification method by using self-attention gating module and gating unit for remote sensing image.

The Code and models will be released after the publication of our paper.
